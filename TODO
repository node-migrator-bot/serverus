TODO
====

* Unit tests using decent require mocking library (Mockery?)
* Decent per-branch configuration
* Port tests to testing.js
* Better commandline handling - each "command" can have its own help etc - expand to init and help commands
* Enhanced web server
    - Mustache templates
    - Some design
    - Editable config
    - auto-update of status, output streams (socket-io?)
    - Show all branches / allow running directly from web UI
